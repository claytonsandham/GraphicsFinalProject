Instructions:

Create a new Visual Studio project.  Expand the indicated zip inside the project folder, and add the .cpp files as existing source.  Add EasyBMP.h as well, for easier reference.  The included main.cpp creates a lovely color using dithering to illustrate the pixel-by-pixel coloring possible.

The EasyBMP_1.06.zip archive also included is for your reference and contains the license for this library.  You don't NEED anything in there that isn't already included.

Your objective for this assignment is to reproduce the ray_gradient image, which was rendered by converting the (X, Y, Z) of each ray's direction into (R, G, B).  Your image will be BMP, it was converted to PNG for size.  This ray_gradient idea was made known to me by Amalia Hawkins (UPenn class of 2013) and she generated the image and gave me permission to reuse it for future graphics courses.

The assignment is worth 25 points.
